# Introduction
<br />
This is a folder where, as a beginner, I am putting my HTML work for display.
The file myPage.html was the first HTML file I created at The Tech Acadamy.
Assignment.html is the second HTML file I've created, this one was created to hold the bare minimum of what was is recommended.

## First Protfolio Website<br>
This is the very first website that I put up on philbosdev.com. It was my last assignment for the HTML module in the TechAcadamy Bootcamp. While not my vision, this was very important to the completion of my next module which taught JavaScript.

## Project 10 Elementschallenge DOM
On this project, I had to look at the HTML DOM Document on W3school [here](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_document.asp) and utilize one of the element properties/methods covered there. I choose to use the ```document.links.length``` element.
